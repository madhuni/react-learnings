Redux Basics:

1) All our app's State use to be centerlize in one single location called 'Store'.
2) An 'Action' is the only mechanism we have, to communicate with the store. Action defines what we would like to do with State.
3) 'Reducers' define what is going to be our final state. The exact
specifics of what happens and how our new state is defined is
handled by our 'Reducers'.
